# Optimal-Garden-Sprinkler-Characteristics- June 2021

This final group project was completed as part of the Statistics 101B- Introduction to Design and Analysis of Experiment course. The rmd file contains some of the code used to generate the results discussed in the PDF report, which contains additional code.

Using an online experiment simulator, the goal of this project was to discover what settings of eight different factors maximize a sprinkler's spray range and minimize its water consumption in at most 20 experimental runs. A fractional factorial design was done to achieve this and further data analysis was conducted on the results obtained.
